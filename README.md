## Description 
The motivation for this project was to refactor code to incorporate a very important aspect of web development: accessibility. The user story was a marketing agency that sought to refactor their codebase to follow accessibility standards for search-engine optimisation. 

### Changes to improve accessibility

* I refactored the index.html file to follow semantic structure. It did not incorporate the use of the article tag and instead repeatedly used the div tag. This was reducing accessibility and so I changed div to article where the contents of the div were an article on the website. This makes it much easier for a developer seeing the code for the first time to understand it, and therefore more accessible. 

* I added 'alt' attributes to images and icons to the HTML. I inserted alt attributes that described the image they were attached to. This ensures that the image is described in the codebase and also that the site is more accessible to somebody using a screen-reader.  

### What I have learnt 

* I have learnt the importance of a semantically structured codebase. It helps a developer to structure the code, making it easier to read and and maintain. Understanding the hierarchy of the code is more straight forward by being able to infer the use of tags in the code just from their names. 

* I understand the importance of accessibility in code. An accessible code base, for example one that includes 'alt' attributes for images, benefits all that use the website. People with disabilites are empowered to access information like anyone else which they may not otherwhise be able to do had the code not been made accessible.
